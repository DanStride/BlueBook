# BlueBook
Very much still a work in progress, BlueBook is a desktop application which allows the user to enter a phrase written in the english language, and determine if there are any phrases which are phonetically similar. 

The suspected end users of BlueBook would most likely be hypnotists, NLP practionioners and musicians/lyricists.
